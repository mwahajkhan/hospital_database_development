## **Instructions**

#SQL Script:

The SQL script provided in the document can be copied as a whole and run in any SQL workbench.
This script will create the entire hospital database along with all the necessary tables and dummy data.
Word File:

The word file includes all the dummy data from the tables as INSERT INTO statements at the end of the document.
Users can copy-paste the entire content of the word file into their workbench to run everything at once.
This will set up the entire hospital database with tables and data.
Complex Queries:

At the end of the word file, there are several complex queries and scripts that demonstrate the detailed functionalities and complexities of the hospital database.
These queries can be run to test and explore various aspects of the database.
